# programming_assignments

The goal is always to write the cleanest, most simple code possible. Focus on readability. Whenever you're programming imagine that 20 years from now a stranger will read through your code. Your code should be "self-commenting", meaning it shouldn't need elaborate comments to be understood. Use descriptive variable names, simple logic statements, and limit the complexity of one-liners. Sometimes it's better to write more code to keep things simple then to write a few complicated lines. However, you don't want to ignore commenting all together. For lines or blocks of code that may need a bit more explanation than just reading through it, write a simple and concise comment on the line(s) above. 



The Python Style Guide is an abbreviated version of the one linked in the references section. It may be difficult to stick to at the beginning, but you'll get used to it relatively quickly. The assignment template is just a starter file that you can copy for each project.
